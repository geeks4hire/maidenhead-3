Maidenhead Parsers
======


This is a simple collection of all of the maidenhead parsers I've had to write
for my HAM projects. For great information, check the wiki page: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System

This code has gone into a few projects and I've just moved the files into here
so anyone can point out bugs that I've made and I'll easily be able to move 
the files back to their source project. This will also make it easy for anyone
who wants to use a Maidenhead Locator System string in their code to interface
with it easily. Most libraries only support 4-6 character grid squares. These 
will all support N%2=0 length grid square names.
